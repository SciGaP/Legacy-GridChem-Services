In order for job submission to work properly, the cgi scripts must 
be checked out from cvs into a directory named 'scripts' within
this folder.  The following should do the trick if run from the
$GMS_HOME/cgi directory:

$> cvs -d :ext:<username>@www.gridchem.org:/home/cvs/CCG co -d scripts \
   GMS/bin/scripts/server/ccg-mw1 -r v0_3_0
